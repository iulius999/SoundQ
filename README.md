# SoundQ

•  SoundQ is an application that allows its users to manage a playlist, search for songs and play music.

•  There are two types of users: admins and listeners, each one having the consent to do certain actions.

•  Admins can play the songs available in the playlist, add songs to the playlist, remove songs from it and accept or reject songs proposed by listeners.

•  Listeners can also play the available music, but they cannot add or remove songs. Instead, they can propose songs which would then be accepted or rejected by admins. Listeners can also search for songs by title and artist.
