•  The Domain Layer represents the heart of music - songs.

•  The Repository Layer stores the melodies and connects the application with data sources - text files, in this case.

•  In the Service Layer, algorithms and logic provide sortings, searchings and filterings, ensuring the correct communication between data and user interface.

•  The GUI Layer is the cherry on top - aesthetics meet functionality to provide an intuitive interface for users.
